# Atheneum

Etheneum is an Android App which aims to provide a solution to manage a Book Library. Designed for both Users/Students and Library Admins, various operations such as adding/removing/updating books, searching books, issuing/re-issuing/returning books, seeing issued books with due dates, collecting fines, etc. can be performed. The App uses Cloud Firestore as the back-end database for storing details of the Books and Users. Firebase Cloud Messaging is used to send realtime notifications to Users if a return deadline is approaching, his/her fine is increased, or when a new book is added to the Library. Cloud Functions are used to monitor the database in order to update fines and trigger notifications.

Feel free to contribute and report issues.
